Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet fun game where two players take turns marking 
spaces in a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol, either an "X" or an "O". 
The goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols aligned either 
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

To play, just select an empty spot on the grid by entering its corresponding 
number when it's your turn. Remember, strategy is keyâ€”block your opponent's 
moves while aiming to complete your line of three. Good luck, and may the best 
strategist win!

Available positions are:
